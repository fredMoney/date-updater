Description:
Python program that updates the "last edited" tag of a file to the current date. Used to keep track of what episodes of a series I've watched.

Usage:
Navigate to the folder the series is in on disk. List the episodes. Pick an episode(s) to update the date. To specify multiple episodes, delimitate them by commas (eg. 2, 3, 4); to specify a range, use hyphen (eg. 2-6). Type "exit" to exit.
Add date-updater to PATH to run anywhere with ease.
